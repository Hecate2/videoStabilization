function [M_cummulative] = motionEstimator(feature)
%UNTITLED: estimate the cummulative motion between each pair of two 
%          adjacent frames.
% Input:
%   feature: a cell whose every element is a feature vector of corresponding frame.
% Output:
%   M_cummulativa: a cell containing the cummulative motion of each frame.
